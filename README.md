![Running a sandboxed Termux environment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yonle/termux-proot/master/screenshot.png)

# termux-proot
A sandboxed, 2nd termux, isolated or jailed termux environment with proot

Test something out in sandboxed environment with 0% Afraid of getting bricked in your real termux. Human is curious, Ain't we?

Also support on non-Android distro, Including Debian, Alpine, and etc.

## Setup & Installation
Before installing, We need these 3 packages to be installed in your Termux:
 * `curl` for fetching & downloading latest termux bootstrap.
 * `unzip` for unzipping Termux Bootstrap.
 * `proot` for start sandboxed environment.

These required packages should be installed in your host/system.

And finally, set up sandboxed environment:

```sh
curl -sLO git.io/termux-proot.sh
chmod +x termux-proot.sh

# Will setup by itself & start sandboxed environment
./termux-proot.sh
```

## Uninstalling
Uninstalling termux-proot is literally, very easy. 

```sh
rm termux-proot.sh

# The command below can use for reinstalling.
proot -0 rm -rf ~/.termux-fs

# The command below can use for reinstalling/Updating Android base system.
proot -0 rm -rf ~/.android-base
```

## Environment Variables
termux-proot also has it's own environment variables and it's changeable. They are:

 * `TERMUX_SANDBOX_PATH` - Path to where Termux sandbox folder located. Default is `$HOME/.termux-fs`
 * `TERMUX_SANDBOX_APPPATH` - A variable that used to simulate Termux app path. Default is `/data/data/com.termux`
 * `TERMUX_SANDBOX_ENV` - A variable that used to reveal a environment variable to guest. Can used like `TERMUX_SANDBOX_ENV="FOO=BAR BAR=FOO" ./termux-proot.sh`
 * `TERMUX_SANDBOX_PROOT_OPTIONS` - A variable that used to add some proot arguments. Can used like `TERMUX_SANDBOX_PROOT_OPTIONS="-b /sdcard" ./termux-proot.sh`
 * `TERMUX_ANDROID_BASE` - Path to Android base system. Default is `$HOME/.android-base`

## Advantages
 * Sandboxed /system
 * More secured

## Disadvantages
 * DNS is static. Should using static resolver that located at `/etc/hosts` or `/system/etc/hosts`. You may need to `echo unresolved-domain.com >> /system/etc/static-dns-hosts.txt` and run `/system/bin/update-static-dns` to get your `unresolved-domain.com` work.
 * Some certain thing is not available (like OpenSLES, dalvikvm, and etc).
 * ARM variant may require a custom seccomp profile to remove restrictions from personality() system call. Whereas Docker Hub contains prebuilt ARM image, it is outdated and won't receive updates anymore.
